And really all the land. Okay, this is what we want to do. Like, because like right now BB modules are like spinning, like. Yeah. So to really identify the whole workflow, what we're doing, what's breaking. Have we done this for any of the other customers or are we just starting with Light Scare or something? We. Based on what I understand. Yes, we're starting with Light Scare. One with the even and two looking clear. Also on the. On the green Tourette's. Oh, yeah. I don't disagree with starting with them. Like, I would say for ifrah, we don't have a workflow map. It's like very much in FDEs heads for most of our customers. Yes, yes, exactly. Okay. The cool part about this one is we can actually use the GDI based nodes. Oh, I should actually. I'm just going to pull in. Oh, my God. Sorry, guys. Right after. Right after I set off figma. God. Exactly. There was a time when they had me make sure a diagram and figma. Oh, yeah, yeah. I was like, that might be helpful. Yeah, sure would. What do you. No, he says it's in a customer. Okay. Okay. So GDI is like our idealized version of intake. No customer is. Yeah, no customer is even close to that, actually. Yeah, yeah. Correct. And so this goal is to ensure that everyone here has. Sorry, I realized I want to make sure my. Oh, I'm just going to connect the OWL so we can hear it. I got. Ow. Can you owl me? I'll owl you. I think it's in your computer. No, you have owl. Wait, who has what? Wait, this is owl. Oh, I do have. Is this owl? Oh, this is owl. Owl's not showing up. God damn it. Is OWL even on? Is all plugged in. Cringe, cringe, cringe. Okay, okay, this is not going to be plugged in. So maybe the recording will not hear some voices. Just FYI. It's fine. So I didn't hear my voice. The most important person is next to me. It's fine. The goal of this again is to like. Yeah, just outline what exists today and then so that we can get to as well as take it out of Fuzzle's brain. Okay, cool. So where do we want to start, Fuzzle? I mean, let's start from the top. Where do we get queues? How do we. How do we intake faxes? Is it from multiple locations? All the rest. So they have an inbox in their ehr. In their first ehr. And we sync with that queue every 30 minutes. So flex app ehr. Is that you say? Yeah, they call it Flexi. Flexi with an IE for some reason. Oh, ie. What the. Well, they called it the Flex app to me when I first joined and then I found that their users started saying flexi and it's within the ie. Just so dumb. It somehow reminded me of like the word paperclip. I don't know why. Remind me. Clippy. Is that what is. Okay, good, good. Okay, so. It syncs every 30 minutes. Okay, great, great, great. Yeah. I mean, not my knowledge. No, this was made such a long time ago, we didn't even have temporal. Is this in like a RPA fashion or API? API? Why do we choose 30? I mean, I think we talked about with them. They said 30 minutes is fine to sync. It's pretty fair. So this is what that looks like. You get a bunch of inbounds if it even. What the. Okay, wait. Oh no, I'm not sure. I don't know the user's still liking either. This is terrible. I was gonna say I haven't seen this on other users. Oh, it says loading. Dude, that's so slow. Does that happen with every script? Just when you're opening up the page. Wait, while you're here, can you do me a favor and go to the eyeball? Eyeball on the left hand side. Oh yeah. Order entry to here. Is it just that? And can you hit review documents on one any like this? Yeah, do that. Okay. It works for you too. All right, get out of here. This is not working for their accusers right now. In all cases. A lot of cases they keep reporting him. Is it. I wonder if it's like a clerk issue. Puzzle and Ally have not been able to figure it out. You're joking. Can you have them try on like incognito or something? It could be some like up configuration. Oh, trying to. Yeah, I would have them do that. Like actually. Okay. Okay, cool. So yeah, intakes from syncs every 30 minutes. Good. So I'm assuming we go through a general like same process of just running it through. Doc Intelligence runs doc through triage, which is what is this? All of it's called doc intelligence. Or is it doc triage then? Doc intelligence. I don't know what that is. The workflow is called doc triage. Inside of it there is document intelligence that drags and issues. Okay, okay, let's. I kind of want to like somewhat call that out. I like classify, I assume like all this. Right. What else? Like extract order. I'm just going to do this individually. So this whole piece, I do what's called a pro gamer move. Boom. So this whole piece is Dr. Dash, right? Yeah. Great. Okay, then what happens after document doc triage, it shows up in the queue. They can choose a few actions. I mean it says referral ntq you need. Yeah. So yeah, it should be already in Flexi from the start. Yeah. Yep. So there's a few things they're able to do. Number one, they're able to populate forms like, you know, submit information and click like you actually like validate submit all that stuff. And then they can. The referral will show up in the Flex app. Also more custom actions that they have, which are kind of things that they had us wanted us to add what they were able to do in the fact that that they wanted to be able to do manual as well. Okay, so we should probably mark this up somewhere. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You see these like buttons? You send facts. That's one of them. So for every single document there's that they received for a patient, there's a send facts button. Can I click this? Yeah. And then this will basically just. It's just a fax out anything to which they have integrated to their ehr to send the fax. Interesting. Okay. Okay, let me write that down. So numerous actions for like users to take here. Sounds like. Well, I mean, I would say there's three. Three main actions. Okay. And you said them like the main action was just like process referral as normal. What does that look like? Populate form. And then, And then where does the submission go? Into the Flex app. Great done making this. You can send it to me and I can make it a lot more detailed if that's helpful. I can go. Sure. Ma', am, More details? No, thank you. God, no. Okay, so that's one. The second one is fax out. Yeah. And that's on a patient, which is why it's like not an action for a patient. It's rather. It's like on the document. Yeah, yeah, for sure. Okay. I kind of want to like get an example of this. Populate forms, like the most used. Yep. Yeah, generally we want to know that the populate forms. Sure. Oh, there's a lot of volume today. I don't know why. Like they did like 60 today. I don't know. Oh, 60 is actually a lot. Wow. I know. I'm like so surprised. I'm like, what the. Wait, they're flexi. No, there's 60 referrals submitted. Yeah, John's been on their ass. We referral submitted specifically. Not even like doc touch. No, they don't do doc touch. That's. They do, but it was before we had doc attached, so it's not like the way we doc test for. Oh, so is it considered referral submitted school? No, it's not even like. Okay, got it. Nevermind. We just classify it for them. We classify. And there's like a. I think for process patients, there's like a button there. You can like upload new docs if a new document is received for an existing open referral. Go to the process. When we get a doc, what happens? We classify it just like we do for every other customer. Okay. It's just they don't really use that. That classification is used when we're uploading docs to the Flex app. But that happens as part of referral submission. Never separate. So they don't upload the referral until they have all the docs they need. Like, what happens if they have. What? Like, I got distracted about here, Sorry. So if they have a referral but only like, don't, like, do they wait until they have all the documents they need for the patient? Generally, I think they. That's how it works. They need to wait for all the documentation to come in. Yeah. Including like demos, insurance cards. That's true. What do you mean? Because when I shouted Chris, I don't think that's what happened. Like, they don't wait or so like, what information do they need before processing a referral? Like, do they need a insurance card? They just need. Yeah, they need. They need. I don't know if they need an insurance card or just the insurance. Like insurance info. Yeah. Okay. A drug subscriber. Yep. That's really it. Like all of your order information that you need. Yeah. And then insurance, actually, just a drug name do they need? Like, what if they're missing, like, patient demographics, like, address or something? Do they care? I don't think address matters. I think. Okay, so they just care about name, date of birth, and then, like, drug information and occurrence information. Yeah. Interesting. And prescribing, right? Right. Yeah. Very, very minimal. I mean, that makes sense. That's like, actually what is needed to create a referral. But there's question marks about. Is this actually true? Sounds like. Like, do they actually. Wait, so wait, what were you saying on process patients? I was saying that if you go to a process patient, you'll see the existing referral tag. There's a button if you click on that thing on the very right. Oh, do I need a specific. Actually, go to one that's. I see this button. What the fuck? I don't see that. Click on one of them. Oh, here. Upload new docs. Ah, that is so custom. Yeah. Insane. This is before we had doc attached to the separate thing. And so does that mean for each patient in here, there's only one patient? Does that make sense for each patient? Like. Like if I search up Steve, Noah in the other things. When you go to process patients, you will usually see multiple per the document. Right. That same concept works here like it should. It's not going to keep attending to the same local patient. It will create a new location. Okay, so there's still multiple local patients, but for each of these, we're with like an attached id. Like, you can still click upload docs. Yeah. Okay. Why is it on a PDF they had us add this in. I'm not even sure if they actually still use it or not. Okay, so sorry, interrupted, because I wasn't listening. What does upload new docs to Flex? So for a patient, if there's new documents that are received, they're able to click this button and it will upload. But I think. Can I click it? I think it will upload. Probably not. Wait, but like, what. What is the new doc we're uploading? Like, we haven't chosen a doc. I think I'm trying to remember. This is. I don't even know if they actually still use this. But. Okay. From what I remember, the problem was that after we would process a patient, we would receive doctors, attach the process patient, and then they would have no way of, like, attaching the new document. Oh, so what they're doing. Okay. Okay, so like, they. They process a patient and then they say like, okay, we don't care about this patient anymore because there's no referral. But if there's supplemental docs that flow in to the incoming tab, I want it to be attached. Now, how this would work for other customers is it would create a new. Actually, I don't. I don't know if it creates new location. I don't remember exactly what flow is. Like, I'm just not quite understanding how this works. So, like, if you click on one of these patients and process patients. Yeah. You know that there's a document that's in incoming patients already, and then you press this button so that it will append documents to this record. Again, I'm not understanding how this works. I don't. I don't think there would be another thing in the NPC to look at. Yeah, because it's like. I think it's like this patient. This patient has been processed, but there are docs associated with that patient that may not have been processed. Would be located under the patient in process patients or. No. No. Okay. You want to think. I think it used to work in a way where the document would show up there, but I think we've since changed it and now we. Would create a new local patient. Yeah, like that's how it works for the other. Create a new local patient so once it leaves out of here. Is that why once it's. Once a patient is processed, then it's always like, creates a new local patient for the same patient. Is that why we end up with a lot of duplicate patients? Reflex. What do you mean? Like, duplicate creations? No, we have duplicates in here, but we'll never. That wouldn't indicate having duplicates. Yeah, so like. Okay, wait, let me give you an i4H example. So like, I forage, there are a lot of patients that come into the intake section that are duplicates or that like, they're. They're multiple patients. Let me just search up. This isn't the category of requests that John made. He. I think he thinks makes sense, but does not end up not even being used ever. Like, I. I would be so shocked if they're telling me they're using this one. So like, so here's a good example in I forage land where we have two of the same patient name, patient, date of birth. Right. Dude, what the. Sorry, one not to two patients, like sets of documents. Yeah, it's like, it's like we infused. We received a. No, they have the same. So. So they have the same. We infused id. So that's why it's not a duplicate patient on the iBreg. It's because we will never, like, we don't duplicate it. But this is just a statement to say, okay, we received a bunch of docs around November 24th. Here they are. Or I guess just one in this case. And then we also received documents on November 19. We went through a same document triage stage of like, okay, we create a local patient that of name Michael Reagan of this date of birth. Then we go into the process of saying, okay, is there an existing patient in. We infuse that we can match with? And then we see it has matched the same. We infuse id but there's still two separate entities. Okay, well, this isn't going to be a problem in autopilot. I mean, it's like a. It's a problem for like auditability. Like, sometimes Ayanna goes in here and she's like, oh, I see there was a patient on the 24th that had this. But like, when you design when the problem be solved, if you just put like in one of those patients, like docs received November 19th. Dr. See, November 24th. Yes. Like have the date received. There is. It sounds like there's a reason we, like, create multiple local patients. Yeah, I'm trying to see right now if we do the same for Plexcare, and I'm almost certain we do, because if we didn't, then it would be a huge mess, because that means that we'd be missing so many incoming patients that would just get linked to existing process ones. Wait, say that one more time. I'm saying reflex here. I'm fairly certain that we do create new local patients, because if we didn't, that means that any patient we've already processed, if we got a new document for them, it just goes under process patient. I doubt we're missing that many. That huge volume of documents. I mean, I would hope so. But there are a large amount of new patients versus existing patients. So if we're missing like 60%, then that could be literally the reason I would. I would highly recommend checking that. Yeah, that's what I'm planning on. Where the. Oh, wait a minute. Actually, actually, I completely forgot. Actually, no, I just clicked. So this whole creation, this whole logic of when do we create a new location, it's not a tenant specific thing. It's an activity that is used for all tenants. Okay. This is not a. So it is absolutely tenant. You can look the activity called mattress create local patient. It's the same one that's used for all of the. Let me double check this. I'm pretty sure create. Yeah. Is there like a strong reason why? Because there is sometimes when we match docs to a single local patient. But then there are a lot of times when we create new local patients. Like what is the tribal reason why we need the matching is if we have first name, last name, date of birth, and they match with another local patient and that local patient is not processed. Okay, so they have to be incomplete patients. Yeah, which is why as soon as a patient moves to processed, we need to create a new incomplete entity to like gather all the docs. Because we treat that as like a new set of documents. Yeah, it's. Yeah, it's almost like a case almost. Yeah. I see. Does that make sense? Yeah, I was just gonna say, can we summarize that and basically say like once we have processed thing, which means someone has reviewed it. In the case of the co pilot, if we receive a new batch of documents, it will never get touched though. Yeah, we're calling that a new case. But in the technical docs, it's actually a local page. New local page. Yeah, they're called local patient. And in the design of what it is in copilot, it's a new row that will exist in incoming patients that is in no way connected, at least in the ui to the existing process. And I actually now it's coming back. I remember why we had the upload new patient. That is, I remember why we did that. But the upload new docs, that was before we made the change to match or create local patient, where we would create a new entity because it was so early, to the point where we didn't even have issues where we would process the same patient twice. And then we started facing that issue. Then we created that logic. And before that the docs would just get linked over here and they would have no way of uploading them. Okay. And then they would go into process patients and they're like, oh, there's a link doc. Okay. So this is actually, actually like a, should be a depreciation. This is actually going to be the question which was do we track in any manner or form whether people click on certain buttons in the app? Because it would be great to know that's something that we should we for certain, for certain things. Not for that button. Oh fuck, probably not for that button. It only exists here. Yes. So how much am I going to have to beg for each every time we upload something to put events? You probably won't have to, but I think, I think nowadays we do a better job of tracking stuff like that. Am I missing a meeting? I'm not missing a meeting. Are we doing a. What? No, no, no. I got dinner plans. Oh, you do? Okay, tell me how it goes. I'm so excited. You got this. Yeah. You got this, chief. Okay, we'll. We'll record. The answer is. The answer is. You won't have to. Like, we use post hog. So we are tracking, like, certain levels of, like, user activity, but I would probably say it's not. It's definitely not every button. I don't know if it's live. Reflects here as we make new things. This is a flag for me as we build out pd. I should, like, add this. We totally have. Yeah, we totally have postdoc integrated. We should have, like, every atom. That's what I'm saying. Like, yeah, every atom, everybody. Like, it's not. I've been there. It's not hard. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Is. Okay, good, good, good, good. Okay. Next thing I wanted to talk about was that incoming patients. This. What this is telling me is that if there's patients with existing referrals, we're actually just, like, hiding new dogs. Is that not what that means? No, because. Because existing referrals in the Flex app are very, very short term. They're like. They don't last. Is there any way to, like, find. No, there's no way to find. Do you remember this? Yeah, you can, like, process. You can brain. Brain process this one because. Yeah, what. What would be bad that's happening is, like, there are new, even referrals coming in that are just like regular renewal orders, but it sounds like if we process them, like, it's hiding. An open referral in the Flex app is extremely short term. It's. It's. It won't last more than I want to say. Open referral. Yeah. Meaning they use the referrals in the Flex app as, like, for a patient's intake journey, like, from, like, RI till PA is submitted. @ that point, they close out the referral. Yes. Now why would we be hiding them ever? They requested it. No, I don't remember why they requested because they're not processing. I assume why they requested it is because they are also processing patients outside of Mandolin. So if they create a referral for a patient in FlexApp, they don't want to have to filter through the patients. They've already created referrals for outside of Mandolin, and they just want to hide all those. Does that make sense explicitly though, hiding the 1. Are they explicitly processing ones that are people that they already have existing referrals from? No, it's like any, any patient that comes in like all of those documents will be shown here. Right. There's a subset of patients where they say fuck Mandolin. That's exactly what it is. Yeah. So they say Mandolin. I'm gonna go in Flex app and just like start the intake process for this patient anyway. Like, like through Flex. This is just like poor copywriting. Yeah. So this is like, this is like outside of it basically should read 921 patients with existing Flex care referrals that were processed outside of man outside of Mandolin. Yeah, yeah. So they're intentionally hiding it so that when they do want to use Mandolin, they don't have to filter through all those patients that they just did. Okay. Yeah. And then like that one week thing is important because this will still catch patients that like, you know. Yeah. The referral is like very short lived. In FlexApp, how do we retrieve the list of patients that were processed? There's. It's an API reading point for getting the entire list of referrals and you can set filters and stuff. So this is so the. So the patient that you display in inbound docs are not as much like get new patients add. What is the current state of water out there? What are the new ones where you get. Yeah, they can't because it's hidden. Because it's an O. It's. Because every single time do a search, we mark. Every time we intake a document, we do a like search verifying that there isn't an open or full for that patient already. I don't get it. Let's say we have ABC, right. At 11:00am and 11:15 someone works on C. Right. And they whatever they completed. Right. So in our app it is still showing C as a temporary like work item. Right. But someone did it 11:30 when we then. When we then go back in and check work items, it only shows A and B. Let's say we have got. Do you remember the insure referral thing? Yeah. Where's the guardrail for like if this referral is already existing for this patient, then don't create it. I think that catches it. So before. So at 11:30 when we re. When we re retrieve the list of open itemplex out, you get A and B. So then we submit. So then we use that as our current like most recent state. I guess because you get the problem. I see the problem. And. Yeah, that. Because if we're just appending new work items we're never. I have to look at how the sync works again but I'm pretty sure. What do I call this. It? I guess a question. More pointed question is how did we retrieve the number nine? That's a good question but I don't have an answer to right now. I don't remember. Please. Oh, oh. Is it opening in the browser? I hate that. There is a way to open in the app I think you press up here and then it's somewhere in there if you can see. Oh, nice. Nice. Wasn't a good customer experience. Holy. I have 61. Let's put a pin in this for a second. What's that? I did. I can add you. Oh wait, no, I knew that. Oh, it's a different. Different figma. A classic. A class. Yeah, I see it. It. All right, keep going. Alrighty. Any other actions that I missed? So. Oh, dude, I saw that. That's hilarious. It's just a button in there that makes me. I don't remember. Yeah, So tell me about that one. I can tell you why they need to push things to asana, which is a button in their ehr. If they want it here too. Do they use it? I don't know. Let me. Let me add a. So if I unlock a patient. Yeah, right here. Dude, I saw this earlier. I was like, no shot. This is lovely. I should have arrowed down do that. Sorry. I'm giving you a better screenshot. That's what you're doing. Okay, well, if you want to highlight it forward to a sauna one. How do I show that? These are custom. I'm going to put them in pink. Light pink. Jesus Christ. Custom. How excited are you to be out of here, man? Sorry, Possible. Don't answer that. Can't come quick enough. Don't answer that. Okay. Swag. Swag. The. What are we doing? What are we doing over here? Nice. Okay, thank you. Okay. All right. Fair, Fair. Oh, nice. Nice, nice, nice. Very good. Okay, that's fair. That's fair. What else? What other actions are you missing? Any actions? I believe we've covered all the actions that they can do. In our eyes, it's just an action basis that they want to stand on as well. Is it like, what. What types of details are forward. Do you know anything about it all? I know that I don't think it, like. All it takes is the referral id. I think in the endpoint, I don't think it's any. You don't have to like populate a custom. Okay, okay. It just like records referral ID or some shit. Yeah, I'm not. How weird. Okay. Okay. I assume they use it to like, project manage. Yeah. Like assign referrals to specific team members. Damn. I wonder if that works a lot. I'm super curious about that one. So, Daniel, that's a great area where like, Ortu Asana. Very custom thing likely. Oh, that's interesting. Wow. You know, just from how I know, like Flex Care, I would highly doubt they use this and I would highly doubt they use Backs out. And I would highly doubt they use any of these custom things that we just said. Okay. So if we. If we move forward to a state where we release GDI, which is like intake 2.0 and it's like a reversion of like some of these features, do you think, like, how would they take that? I will be so honest. I don't think they notice. Okay, great. But we don't have. Yeah. Caroline does not know either. Yeah. I mean, yeah. I wouldn't know how to be honest. Caroline doesn't. She would not. And I'll tell you, I don't even think John would know who else was. It was just you owning Flex Hair before Caroline joined, right? Yeah, it was like literally just. Okay. Classic fd. Okay. Documents. Oh. Oh, yeah. What is that? Email Fax Documents. Does that. That's for all customers. Is that for all customers? What does that. What does that button do? I actually don't even know. It just pulls up the modal. Ah, yes. Okay, so this is actually standard across all patients. One of the obvious ones, I guess. Yeah. It's just like. We should list the standard. Is that what you're about to do? Yeah. Okay, thanks. This is gonna be a really fun exercise to try to align this with gdi, Daniel. Yeah. I wonder who's gonna do that. We should go for comprehensiveness even if it's like. Well, so for, like. Okay, what I should actually call out is, like, a lot of these here. I'll give you an example. Like, if I unlock this patient and go like this, like, you can email fax documents for a processed patient. So when we, like, think about gdi, we think about what it takes to get an incoming patient to a processed patient. And usually. Yeah, so there are, like, Right. I'm calling out a lot of, like, actions. Not in the workflow stage where you're taking a patient to be processed, but in, like, a table stage where it's like, okay, per patient in this table of, like, a list of patients, like, what actions? Or a list of documents like what actions after, like, AI has processed this, could I potentially take, you know, like, adding tags, like emailing out the document, etc. Okay, so sorry to re. Agree that with what I was saying. These are effectively evergreen actions that you typically would only do after process, which means they are irrelevant to our. How do we get from the initial point to process? I would say yes, yes, yes. They're like post gdi. How I think of gdi, at least how the team is thinking of gdi, I'll label that somehow, like additional actions or something. Okay. Or additional. Sorry. Unrestricted. Okay. What else are we. Oh, oh, oh. Submit to Flex app. Does this do anything else? Does it post log note? Does it. Yeah, so it does quite a few things. It will. If it's a new patient, it will create a patient in the infuse. Oh, okay. This is good to know. Yeah. There's a lot of action. So it will create patient. If it's a new one. If it's a new one, and there's information that will add that to we infuse. If the patient already exists, we'll just create the referral Inflex app and link it to that existing patient. So if. New patient. Yeah. And after that, if you have a transformation from the ri, if they enter in the we infuse insurance plan, then we create that in we infuse. If they enter the insurance plan in what RI and ri, then we will also create insurance and. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna. I'm gonna let you clean this up. Oh, do we create order and re infuse as well? No, no, no. They. They create any drugs or. Insurance is not the same person. You said. You know how you said we have to write it? Right, Right. So all I meant by that is. Yeah, he's right. So, like, we infuse and the Flex app don't really have a sync. Meaning, like, the list of insurances in the Flex app is different from the list of insurances we infuse. List of medications is different. So fun. The list of the things that are the same, though, what does carry over? Like patients created and we infuse will automatically have like a FlexCare ID and providers created. The we infuse will be created in Flex app as well. And locations and we queues will be created in the Flex app as well. Or the one to one. Okay, so all of those lists are one to one. But makes sense. Insurance is drugs or not. Okay, Insurances. Orders. Orders don't carry over. None of that. Oh, like when you say drug, you mean like the list of drugs? Yeah, list of drugs, but also the orders don't carry over. Interesting. So, like, creating it. This is not at all related to creating order. Yeah, I'm just going to write this down. Then they will match the patients and then it will link that to the referral. Link it to the referral. It will create a new order. When we're. When we're actually, like, creating a referral in the Flex app, we have to link it to a patient. It'll just match it to the existing one. Like, it'll find the existing patient and we infuse. Yeah, the existing, like, the concept is like, when we're doing patient searches and reflex care, we're doing them and we infuse. Yep. And if they exist, then we can also do a search inside the Flex app and find the corresponding id. Sorry, I'm probably confusing you. This makes sense so far. Okay, so far makes sense then great. If patient exists and we infuse, it will 100% exist in Flex. Yep. We can't. If we create a patient and we infuse, it exists in the Flex three times. Now, if we create a patient that flex that though, it will not transfer to what we infuse. Okay, so in terms of how we create patients, we actually always do. We do in. We infuse first and then this auto creates and flex up. Exactly. Understood. But you did mention some things that can be done, like creating referral doesn't happen in a lot of places, Like adding insurance and we just not do anything in the Flex app. So how do we. Drew, wouldn't it be, like, critical to, like, know these things? I guess, like, yeah. What all happens in Flex. I know. Like gets inherited in the Flex app by two. The only one that gets inherited, the only action that gets inherited is created. Okay, and how about creating an order in the order interface? The only actual transfers is creation. Okay, and then the next question is, out of all actions in re infused, which ones are to be reflected. For the patients? I think. Yeah, just it'll be there like immediately. Then what about insurance and drugs? We're not like, we're not. Remember, the Flex app is not really for keeping track of a patient's like information over a long period of time. It's just for that single referral. Like if I'm creating insurance and we infuse, it's kind of like that, like a, a record that was for a long time. Like, okay, this is the insurance that this patient has on file for the referral that we're creating. The Plex app. It's kind of like a short term thing. We just need for that, like, for that kind of. Yeah, exactly. Right. And like, you know how it was just one API call to click the entire thing? Like, I have no way of like going in and changing it or if I did, it wouldn't really do anything. And then what was the request that came into a while back? Adam Mavi. Right. So that was like the one that we didn't go over today, which we will. We would have for next time, is the fact that we have a data mapper from the Flex app to our database. So for the similar how we do it for Lean, she's like, we have, we have a thing that can look at an order and create a core.org or we have a thing in Lean fees that can create core dot, patient, core dot insurance plan, whatever. Similarly, we have a thing that can populate R4 drugs with the, with the FlexCare drugs. So from their EHR, using the Read operation we have, we can populate horde locations with Flex Care from the Parks Care app, therapist clinics. And then we have a map for that. Maps, insurance plans. Those are the three things that we're mapping. They are independent of our tasks. Yeah, those run every, every hour, Everything like that. Yes, everything gets synced. RPA or aps. Is it running all day or during all day? Yeah, It's just a endpoint. Right. It's a function like a cron job or something. Cloud. Yeah, Cloud scheduler. Okay. Yeah, because they're not updating it very fast. Frequently. I think it's like how often are they. No, it's. It's not. It's not. They have a pretty set list of garage and grab one. It'll be like every month. Yeah. A couple times a quarter. Yeah. I'm just curious because they did request in those. That's because we didn't have the sinking at that point. We were just kind of doing whatever they said. They were adding something new. And now I made that. Okay. Good time. And that information only lives in. Well, sounds like it. Yeah. Like we can't from. We infuse only. We can call us to drugs. We definitely can't pull out some insurance and we cannot. But that's not a voice, right? Yeah. Am I missing anything here then? So actions are do sync. Creating patient information that syncs. I'm missing one here, actually. Drugs, clinics and insurance plans. Clinics is core locations. Insurance plans is core insurance plans. I believe core what it actually could be pay yours with an E or an O. There's a core. Now let me check which one. Is common. You mentioned locations, providers and something else that syncs. That does sync locations, providers, patients. No patients. Like creating a patient. Like creating a patient in wood sync. Oh, you mentioned one more earlier. Maybe not. That's it. Okay, so for existing patients, by the way, is this right? Do we actually update. Oh, I see. Okay. Do we. For existing patients, do we go and update. We infuse or do we just match? We don't update anything for we. For existing patients. That's crazy. What's the point of what? So if it's an existing patient, what do we. I think we just match it. We match it and then we're not creating duplicate. We put that. We put that match in what Flex app or. No, do we. What do we do with this? I'm saying basically, like if it's an existing patient and we get docs for them, we match it. Which is like, cool. We found the patient and then we just make sure not to do anything. Well, they wouldn't. They don't even. They're not even able to populate forms. It's not an order form. Okay, so imagine if it's an existing re infused patient where it's a new order. What happens? It would create the referral on. On an existing patient. Yeah. And we do put that in. We infuse. No, it doesn't go into we infuse. It goes into Flex. It only goes into FlexApp. Nothing goes into. We infuse. Got it. Got it. Okay. Okay. So we still yeah. So we submit all patients here, but then for only new patients, we also make we infuse actions. Which one is including creating the patient infused and then updating insurance fields. Is this. Does this all happen in one stage one API call to. We infuse. Like we infuse create patient with insurance names. No, insurance is separate. Okay, okay, got it. Why don't we add insurance insurances to existing patients? Like imagine. I think we do. I probably just misspoke in. We infuse. Yeah. Okay, wait, undo that. Daniel. We may create insurances for existing patients who infused. You can just. You can look at. Move it over there. Right? Because it's like if there is a new insurance field. Exactly. Right. Right here. Or. Yeah, yeah, that's good. Yeah, we do it for all. Okay, great, great, great. Yep. Okay, you do the problem. Is there any other actions log notes? We do post log notes actually, like when we can take process in order. Yeah, we do. We do. We do. We. I like to check. I definitely pulled up flexi one time. I think we do it for like if we're going to pick up a bb, then we say like, hey, we're about to do the bb. Yes, we do do that. Oh, wait, how does this connect to bb? Just. Just as a final thought. And then we'll close. The referral was a normal referral and It's a tier 2 or 3 drug and we kick off a BD. Okay, I am going to put that here. Oh, So if. Okay, wait, say that again. If it's a normal referral and It's a tier 2 or 3 drug, define normal referral. Not duplicate, not renewal. Or I'm just gonna like write it down so I don't. Not renewal, etc. What? And drug Change or does change. Those are the three categories I use. And ideally that one won't happen soon. Then we kick off a bb. Yes. Beautiful. Who is that? Okay, okay. And then that connects beautifully all the way to this right here. Oh, bb. So simple, man. Okay, nice, nice. Being anal on this because I'm new. Is this correct? I wanted to write the rules. Yeah, yeah, that's right. This is what constitutes a new baby. No, this is when we kick off a bb. Oh, sorry. No. As in that is the specific condition for that. Yes. Yes. Wasn't normal for. That's just how they name it in their ehr. That's why, like, they literally have a subtype called normal Referral. That's so funny. Nice. Okay. Would you say vibe check? Would you say. What percentage of completeness do you feel like we just extracted? 85. 85. That's actually pretty good. Wow. Yeah, not really educated. More like things like changing task statuses. We didn't touch on cleanup order entry, which is also happens here. Technically we can get really granular with like patient statuses. What else missing? Oh, auditing tax changes in FlexApp. Yeah, like we. We saved it in our database whenever we do audit log because they wanted an API to pull from. I don't think they'd be. So. Wait, we'll put a pin in that one. Jesus. Okay. Okay. You have shit that made me do it that I'm used. Yeah, that should not happen in the future. We need to be very cognizant about that. Wait, anything I just missed that you mentioned updating fields. I think task. Is that what I should call it? Yeah. Oh, true. Like the circle shit. Yeah. The last thing we should talk about, actually. We can talk about the order entry level. Okay, so where does that happen? At the very end as well. So you know how for local patients, when it's. When we're done. For most other tenants, we just call it like a pro. We set the status like processed or whatever, and then it shows up in the process tab. So what we do for them is instead of setting it directly to processed, we set it to a status called ready for review. Now. Ready for review. It basically just throws it another queue. And this queue is for we infuse order entry. Now, the point is that they have a separate team that looks these separate page and then they can see a list of all of the patients that are in this ready for review stage. And basically their users will go in there and they will just do the web entry. So the exact same deal that we have for like, I for H OI it's basically the exact same form, And then it'll just create an order. Oh, is this like from the WE infused messaging center? Where does order entry happen? No, this is purely populated from our RI Like, WE things only enter this queue after ri. Okay. Is it ready for review story? No, no, this is. So. Yeah, this is like a tab in. In Mandalay right here. Let me see that. Where is that? If you go to the app, it's not here. Yeah, that's like a way you can see it, but there's an eye icon on the left. That's where you see within the car order entry. This is what it is. Yeah. Okay. So I don't know why we have a certain. Yes. Flex Care. He's a reload. Do you see this? The tabs won't show up. Yeah, it's not showing sometimes if you're paying attendance, if you change tenants. I see. Thank you. So order entry happens after. Okay. So like between incoming process patients, there's this like, order entry step that they wanted. Yeah. Is this. This is all custom, I imagine. Yes. Okay. Got it, got it. Customers have like. I know Vivo has their own order entry. Yeah. So this is just a separate queue that their. Their team works in Mandolin out of. Yeah. Okay. How many. What's the percentage of docs that goes through here? Do you know? Ballpark. Put it through ready for. Otherwise it's process patient. If it's a normal. For all, we put it through ready review. Otherwise it's process patient. Yeah. Oh, so if it's like a drug change, we don't put it in order entry. Okay, that's. That's good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You. You got it. You got it, bro. Perfect. Oops, that's wrong. No, that is right. Yes. It's doing both of these things and then there's a no. And I didn't really hear what it does with it. So now it just has to process patient. Yeah. Hold up. Oh, by the way, the no case can also pick up. So regardless of whether. Oh, wait, am I tripping? No, I think. I mean, assuming that it does. Yeah, that's fine. No case would just be. But this kind of. This kind of happens in parallel. Like, this isn't blocked. Yeah, the BB's not blocked by that at all. So. So I don't know how to, like, represent that. I don't know how to. Yeah, like it always happens. No, no, no, but, like, looks janky. I know it looks unclear, but this is saying. Wait, no, this doesn't. This. This is actually not true, is it? You said we don't kick off a BV if it's not a renewal, it's not a drug change, It's a. Oh, yeah, you just said that. Right. I think that was important to say is that if it's an. Actually, you're right. It is the same condition. Sorry. You're right. Yeah. Same thing. So if. So. But there's a case for which. Like, if It's a tier 2, 3 or. We don't care about tiers for the first thing. Yeah, we don't care about tiers for order entry. True, true. Okay. So they are different triangles. Or we can make it separate into two triangles. Sorry. So if it is tier 2 or 3 is the only difference, right? Yeah. And then if it is tier two or three is when we do the order entry stuff. That's over here. Yep, Yep. Oh, no, no. Sorry. BV. BV only BV. So it does not have to be a tier 2 or 3. Correct. To do order entry. Correct. Yes, correct. Just help me out and then. Yeah, yeah. What the f. I want it to be the same terminus. So we're not. Yeah, Let me just help you out. Okay. Okay. So it only does kickoff BB if it is a tier 2 or 3 drag. Correct. Regardless of whether these silly things are true. No, no. Those need to be true as well. Yeah. Sorry. No, but this isn't. This isn't no anymore. Actually, like, this should just be deleted. Yes. Yeah. Like, you should delete this and then does anything happen in the no case? Basically, like. Yeah, basically what happens for. If it's a drug change, a dose change, Literally nothing happens. Great. You've already created for all. Enough. This is so big. Yeah. I want us to be using diamonds as much as possible because I think that is an explicit way to do logic. That's correct. Correct. Very much. Very much true. Yeah. Look at that knowledge drop. And I'm sitting here going like that. Diamonds different than a square. Let me know. All right. I'm gonna do this really quick. You're feeling a challenge to its power. I'm gonna do this. I'm dead. Just because it's like, not. Yeah, this is right. This is right. This is right. This is right. This is off by two pixels. Daniel, I'm pretty frustrated about that. Patient is ready for review. Like, this is just like. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm gonna do. I'm actually. Yes. Well, actually, orange initially was. Is this an atom versus. Is this not? So it's not an atom, but that's fine. No, you. You. You should you should represent it how you want to represent it. Yeah, man. Okay, so we've knocked off order entry from this list, actually. These are. So what do we think we're at 85, 90. Yeah, we're at 95. 95. Yeah. The rest of the. Is just task updates, which aren't, like, particularly. Like, they're important, but, like, they're not. This was a good exercise, folks. Yeah, this was fun. We did a great job. Yeah. We didn't even do that. No, you did. There's actually another piece. Right. We just did. Jay's been yapping. Yeah. Yeah. See? So, like, if it's a normal referral, we start doing order entry. They work through that. We also ask if it's a tier 2, 3 drug, we kick off. I guess the way you describe it, the reason I actually mentioned it, because I saw kickoff. BV is a leaf here in this tree. Right. But I thought it, like, automatically gets picked up after a B. They get kicked off simultaneously. Yeah. I think it's parallel. Is that how we have it currently, or is that how they are parallel in the code? Currently? How do we want it? No, no, I told you that they are parallel right now. I think the. We've asked Caroline what they want or how they use it, but from what I understood, the reason that we even separated in the first place was because they wanted to do the BV first. So I'm not. I imagine that's probably correct, where you just like, okay, we're ready to kick off bv. Like, just get that started, because that could take a day. Okay. Yeah. It's not dependent on the output of bv, is it? It's. I told you that it's supposed to, like, they. They. They claim that it is now how much they actually, like, use. I know. I don't know. No, I'm. I don't agree with you. I'm saying that they claim that it matters. Oh. But I'm not saying that it. I'm not saying that they do use it that way or like, they actually treat it like it is important. You know what I'm saying? Like, I would actually be very not surprised if they did not give a. About the beat, even though they claim to. About it. That makes sense. Like, they've. They don't know what they're doing. Okay. But you. But the way that our thing is designed is it does it in parallel. Yeah. All right. In the interest of getting out of here, I was going to do, like, a final review and make sure that this is correct. Yeah. Cool. Let's do it. So flex that. Flexi hrq, and then we're going to run that doc through doc triage, extract the patients, classify sections, extract order, extract demos, extract returns. This is all very familiar, so I'm assuming that we don't need to factor anything. Cool. We get so far? Fuzzle. Yeah. Cool. Great. API syncs open patient referrals from Flexi so that we can determine whether the patient has an open referral in Flexi. And if it does, then these referrals will be hidden and no work will occur. And that hidden thing is this little. This little guy? Yeah. Which I'm gonna figure out more about. That's a question. Other questions? Yeah, sorry, sorry, sorry. Hold on. I do not see. I'll repo. Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. That was actually such great following. I fully thought you were. No, I mean, it's like. Like we can click it and then like, I like, it just follows his. It just follows his view automatically, Guys. So we only check for whether we want to go ahead post processing or does this happen? Like, what if. Like, is there any way we do this without having started the function? Oh, that's fair. What does that say? Sync open. Like. Like if we sync a furl from flexi and then we match it to a doc that comes in. Oh, no, but we have to process the doc in order to determine if it's a patient. But I think he's saying, like, we could theoretically be doing a bunch of these. Like one of these things may or may not be done to do that. Like, basically this might. This thing might go before some of these. Right? I mean, is that a reason to even begin processing it? Like. Like we get new information every 30 minutes. Yep. Yep. Right. Is there a reason to wait for the doctriage to complete and then determine whether we want to go ahead with it? Because in an ideal world, we just have. We just maintain the state of that table based on every time we get new information. Right. And then doing the work off the table is a separate task. Right. This corresponds to maintaining the state of the table. Of the table. So this does. It doesn't make sense for us to do this while we've been processing. I mean, there's the cost of doing unnecessary work when we do determine the zone already processed it. But that's besides the point. Yes, it is possible, but the only thing that needs to happen which does happen in doc triage is determination of patient, including date of birth. Like, we need to extract some information of a referral or like any doc in order to even determine if we should be hiding these from the open referrals from plesa. Not quite. Not right, disagree. Because we already show it in the patients table to begin with. Yeah, so we had all the information we needed to show it in the table. So presumably the next time it happens, we still have the same amount of information. So if it doesn't the payload we would have enough information to determine that. Like there's some extract patients. Right. From what I understand, like some portion of doctriage is when it shows up in the table. I just don't know where in this system it shows up in the table. Oh, so when does it. When does it show up in, in the table. So in inbound dogs that this kicks off when a person starts processing it? No, you're saying it only has kicked off. This is all AI this is all like, like, literally all the same. It gets downloads a bunch of documents, it runs them all through. But is the inbound docs post like what. Yeah, exactly. What you. I think you're right. Like, I think it maybe it's extract patients. It's somewhere in doc triage where like, like, like we, we actually added. Okay, what. Where we start showing it in. Yeah, exactly. Because I thought that was part of the table. Process that and then show you the minimum amount of work to determine what road show what road. This. This diamond does technically come somewhere. Yeah, like. Like. Like it is some portion of this. And then we are doing like a small portion of like duplicative work that we may not have to be doing. But like. Yeah, Good question though. Oh, fuck. Okay. No, no, I'm. I'm back. I'm back. Go follow. Okay. Yeah, I think we. We said like hidden. Great. And assuming that it is not an open referral, then we go to incoming patients, which is on the tab somewhere. Cool. Cool. Great. Most of the time we're going to care about this, but there are some things that we think we can probably in the forward to a sonic case deprecate. In this case, it's the thing that waits our. I think we have to just like ask Caroline to talk to them and say, are you guys actually using this or not? Yeah, I think that's a key action if you want to add. Can you add that to the open hand? Yeah, I just don't want these points to be lost. Where are the open end? Do we have openers? Oh, here. I. I don't think I do. It's just like a slack chat. Jay's being a God deployment person right now. I don't have the capacity to store this in my brain. So. I appreciate you dumping this. I know that it's saying it out loud is just not exactly. Exactly. You're saying we don't pay attention to the grain and look at those action items. Okay, cool. So things happen. Click populate form. We fill out the fields and then we submit an order to the FlexApp. Crucially not to Crucially. Crucially, they fill out fields endpoints. They are always an alternate to the majority case. Right. Like it's either this or this or this. No, those are. They could happen. Wait Explicitly. It's not hiddle. Because we're not. We're not autopilot for Flex Care. Correct. Yeah, we're not. Yeah. So we are only co pilot where like they are working in Mandalorian. Just call. Okay. So we've done a lot of AI processing but like they are doing all the final step. This doesn't happen. This can happen like simultaneously. There's not one or the other. It was not one only. It's either this or this or this. Right, True. Yeah, true. They could all be taken. So this is. These should really just be grouped in the actions that you had. You should just be up here tomorrow. Right? Exactly. But keep them. Keep them pink. So this main tributary always happens like that is the workflow. Yes, but this always happens yeah, well, always. Unless the patient just sits in the queue. Right? But, yes. Okay. Nice, nice. All right. Keep driving. Sorry. Okay, we can start with, like, when it is. These are two things that happen. One is order entry, and one is, like, creating a patient. How are these different? Wait, hold on a minute. Where's the submission? Oh, wait a minute. Hold on. Leave this out of order. Submit order to Flex app. That happens after the whole. All this. Okay, wait, sorry, Half after what? Like after all the patient determination stuff. That's essentially the final step. Yeah, like that is the final step. Okay, nice. The final step before the BVN order. So Daniel new patient is still in the 10. So that should just say like. That should say like they click the submit button. Like they should click submit. There you go. Right. And then it starts processing based on a certain. Certain logic. And these two little diamonds are correct because we want to represent that. It does some logic in ours and some logic. We'd only. We'd only kick off a BB if we submitted the order to flex up. I think like logically or if this stuff is true. Right, yeah. I'm just saying that like that should come like the arrow should come from submit order to Flex app. It should come after that. It is after that. So all rules need to submit all of Flex app. Which then kicks off. Oh, we should just move all this downstream. So this actually comes after all this. Sorry, I'm ruining your beauty. No, no, this is good. Yes, yes, we can clean it up. And then this is like. Wait, wait, wait. Is this right submit or. No, it should have enough or submit order. But when does BB kickoff. Wait, the kickoff BV thing is it's separate, right? It should be like the very end. Oh, BBC check the conditions. And then. Oh, yeah. Did I just delete that? Did I just do that? I think you did. Okay, so this has. This still happens at the end here? Yeah, very end. And then. Exactly. And then just connect. And then this just gets connected here. Okay, great, great, great. This is probably more accurate. What happens if it's not terminus? If it's not a dupation and it just matches it to the existing one and then. And then what? Doesn't do anything. This is our discussion of like nothing happens, right? Yeah, it could just. It could create an insurance and we view that error was correct. But then it doesn't like finish like it doesn't do any of this shit. Right. Why wouldn't submits the order to the Flex app. Like if it's an existing patient, it doesn't submit the order. Oh, what the fuck? Okay. Oh, we just don't a new patient reading for us. Like so existing patients do. Okay. Yeah. Sorry. Yep, yep, yep. Okay. Nice. Okay. Submit ordered flex app. This is good. Must all be true. If. If some. Before this. We're just determined if it's a new patient versus not if it is a new patient. We just create. Yep. And then if it's existing, we. It's basically articulating that if it is not a new patient, it still has the chance to. Yes, correct. And it will certainly also update submitted in order to Flex app. And once it submits an order to the Flex app, it is then going to do a determination of whether these things are all true. And if these things are all true, it's going to do order entry. Right. Okay. What's the difference between submit order and order entry? Submit order. It should say submit referral. Technically, because it's submitting a referral. Yeah, it's the referral that you put in the Flex app and then order entry is this separate entire screen. Yeah, it's about Flex versus like our own system. Flex versus we infuse. We can box that out later. But I think what we're effective well is that indicating that we've filled out all the fields that we have to on the Mandarin app and lit. Now it's good to go. Like. Like what exactly is being submitted? Like, it's like the thing that I showed you, remember, like where you can see the. Like when you click on the referrals, you click on a patient, you can see the patient name, location, insurance prescriber. No, I'm talking about in the Flex side. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. But like what is the thing that's missing it? Yeah, that. Exactly that. Like the. From the form fields. Right. So here the person has filled out everything they have assumption is that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that kicks off both order entry and later a bv. Right. Okay, great. Okay, we did what order entry is. Sorry. Yeah, so order entry is. So once this patient becomes moves from incoming to. So referral intake, we have the incoming patients. They basically themselves will specific to them. Yes, it is a specific to them thing where they'll like process this patient by like adding all the order information, confirming that the fields that we extract from AI are correct. Once they do that, it enters a separate queue called order entry where it says ready for review. Where people on their team, I imagine outside of the intake team, like there's two teams that are monitoring like the intake queue as well as the order entry queue are looking at this ready for review patient list that. That kicks off downstream processes like vv like other things. Yeah, yeah. All this is great. It's very complicated. You did a great job. But all order entry does is. Yeah, that's it. Can you show me what the task here looks like? So I would go click review. Can I do this? Okay, so it's a. Oh, this is kind of nice. Loki. So I have patient, I have insurances. So basically I'm. I'm. This is like a secondary confirmation of like what the intake team is doing. Any more value? No, no, wait a minute. Scroll down there's. Because the. Well, it. I don't know how to explain. If you can. You can minimize. Oh, nice, nice, nice. This is all the order specific fields like the. Like the. Duration, frequency stuff. And this will create it in weed views. So that is a value that is not being populated in the main RI like flow. It also is. It also is. Yeah, it's like a double work. No, it's not. That is a option. They have to enter information there, but they don't, they don't have to, they don't use it. So when do they. When do they make the. The. The decision to to my knowledge, move it from here to there? It. Well, if it's normal referral, it'll always go automatically. No human intervention. Hold on, are you asking me when it goes from? So like yeah, an incoming patient goes in, like we get a new referral. Right. Are you saying that once we get a new referral this will automatically create an order entry? No, no, no. Only after it's submitted in here. Right. So. So I have to like as a user like unlock this populate form. Yeah. Which looks very similar to this is what we're saying. Oh yeah. But those fields in the referral intake form are plex care specific for the most part. And here they're reent specific to not include these there. So there's only one submission because there's. Their claim is that the people who do the referral intake, they're different people in the Philippines are not equipped to do the order entry step which is more. Requires more clinical knowledge. Okay, so they have two people in the Philippines just doing like a very general. Literally just like a passes document and then they. And fill out. Because in that point all you're doing is putting in a drug name which is just reading the document. But like for the clinical stuff, like figuring out dosages and all that stuff, they want clinicians to do that who are more experienced. Do we want to know that this is like done by different teams? Yeah, that'd be nice. But Jay, to your point, like for all intents and purposes there are like pieces of work that then their clinical team onshore kind of re. Verifies like drug name which is included in this review stage. Well, there is. This serves two purposes based on understanding. Re Verification. Sorry, like verification. Verification of clear things. But more importantly like the new fields, like, like, like Prolia, like this is like here. Yeah. I'm not sure how much verification really happens because like they can't really use this. They're not going to be able to change anything from here and that we've already entered in. I mean they, they literally can change prolia. No, sorry, like we haven't entered this one already. This is new. I'm saying like all the stuff that we entered previously in RI cannot really be changed. Okay, so the people offshore that enter prolia this will not be a field that can be changed during order entry. No, it is changeable. Wait, I'm saying that the stuff that's. Sorry, nothing's been entered into wean pieces yet. I'm saying whatever they've already submitted into the Flex app. Like we already created the reporting Flex app, right? With information that's not like editable from here. Oh yeah. Okay. Okay. Oh, that's interesting. So you're saying like gives the illusion of it being editable but you cannot really edit well, it is editable for we and fees but not for flexibility editing. It's like submitting to we infuse question is here. Wait. Okay. The very top is a referral summary. The whole point of that being there is just whoever's. Glancing at. You can just quickly look at the information. Yep. On stuff on the bottom. It's all net new fields that have not been entered anywhere yet. Right. But what if the Filipino. Filipino dude, like, entered the wrong do. Let's say like this. Like this? Yeah. I mean, that's, That's. I. I don't even know. But these fields are not editable. These fields are not editable. Right here. Basically overview. Right on the screen. Adding new. Okay, okay, okay, okay. So does that mean in the. In the populate order or whatever this. This is called in the inbound documents. What's it called? Populated order. Sorry. Populate form that does not include drug information at all. Only drug name. Only drug name which is editable. Guys. So click on that button. This button? No, they'll show only referral copies and then populate one of them. What? Click, Populate it. They have the ability to do a wimpy entry. Scroll down. Scroll down. Yes. Hold on. Like, to the referral form. Okay, sorry. Yeah, okay. Okay. I don't know. So referral form. Yep, yep, yep. Scroll down more so you'll see there's the also enter weimgies button. So they have the ability here because. Wait, where, Where, Where? I'm blind. Oh, thank you. Thank you. So they can enter in the information here as well if they wanted to. So this would circumvent. Because they have the ability to do it here in case they wanted it. So this would circumvent the order entry. That is fascinating. Yeah. Okay. But two questions smaller one would be, have we introduced the idea of both teams working out from the same ui, given that that's how we initially started. And what's wrong with that? They don't have, like. They wanted it to be separate so that. Because they had people who were only supposed to be doing the first part, doing both. And they didn't like that because they're entering and correct information all the time and they had to go in and manually edit all the orders. Okay. So just for their usability that they want to use. Yeah. Now if I could go back, I would have pushed back and probably found a better way to like, in, like put both things into this. But I did not. That's fine. Foresight. Yeah. Why was Crowley added? Because I think the way this works. So I think in most cases they do click the also enter. They'll edit, they'll put stuff in, and it's whoever's job is at the next step to review that they put in the right stuff. And then like. But you mentioned, the drug name can be entered without so the drugs. You see this. There's a Flex Care medication. So that goes on to Flex app. Everything beneath that will go like these are we in for medications? Oh, these are two separate medications. What the. Now, the stuff on the bottom will not be submitted. It'll be sent to the next step for. Understood. Understood. Okay, so this is actually the. The Flex Care one is crucial that this cannot be edited in the order entry stuff at all. The we Infused medication. You. You can like, like populate this early, but then in the order step is really when you. The confirmation happens and it gets sent. I think we'll get into reams. Yeah. So that also means that there is a potential for having two different drug names in Flex Care and we infuse for a given patient. Because they like edited it. Yeah. They have different. And that's okay with them. It has. I mean there have to be. Because there. There's no like one to one mapping. They're completely separate lists. And then how interesting do they ever. No one knows this circumventing flow well that float. I don't think it ever allows entry into we infused directly. This always doesn't. I know. I think I did say that. That's why I'm double. Yeah. So this is only re infused medication. I see. Yeah. I have to check. That is so fascinating. So the wait is. Is flexcare that is flexcare the customer that their own process was so fucked up that as you can clearly see. So flex here is a great example of like we took on a customer where their leadership or their people like weren't confident in their own process and so it's causing a lot of. They're very confident in the process. Oh wait, really? That's only the problem. That's actually the problem is like they're so unwilling to change it because they're so like this works and we don't want it to be different at all. Problems that arise from anything. Yeah, like adjusting to the flow. Yeah. 100%. Interesting. So we should note that or just in our heads that change management is going to be difficult for them as we go to the gpi. What was the thing I told you to add? Because I don't. It was the. Port. Oh, you're putting it there. Oh, sorry. Just the table. Oh, sorry. Yeah. No, just so we have one source because I figured you is. I would say it's not overriding order because there's. There's like the Flex Care drug name and there's the we infused drug name. So they're actually separate entities. They're only editing net new we infuse fields. But that's with the knowledge that all of a sudden their. Their Flex Care drug name and their re infused drug name could be totally different if the intake offshore team fucked up their intake off with our sure team. Yeah. Very, very fascinating. Would you also say that that is the case because we didn't give them the rails to run the train on and they're like okay, well this works for us to do this instead of like okay, how do we alarm. Do you have a clear process. Like I said, like the first time we ran this, it was all in one form. Like every single thing was the same way that it is right now. We're going to click Always enter reviews. We didn't have that button. It had every single field to do both the referral entry into Plugs app and the order creation we did because that's how it worked, but they asked us to change it because the people that were working it were entering in stuff wrong all the time. I'm even saying just overall, do you. Think that is the reason why they're so overfit here, because they didn't quite receive a great template from us on what to do. As in, like, we didn't train them properly enough on the app to do that. Like, we, I mean, that's definitely part of it. I think if they had a better experience with it. But, like, how do we like that? A good question. I think one of the things that we didn't have in the app, right. Like, that we would have in the next version of this is, like, roles to, like, do certain tasks or whatever. Like that. Like, we can make this all into one thing. Where we have an atom for Weaver. Exactly. That could only go to a certain team. Right. Like, that's. It solves the exact thing. This is, like, so Adama. In fact, in my opinion, it could be the same order Adam, but it's just like, it gets duplicated or, like, kicked off later, or at least the same ui. Exactly. Because it will be the same. That's how it generates, but it's just like a different role that takes this next step. Time. Yeah. So that was really it. I, I, I just think that they. Okay, yeah, they have two people, Chris and Clarence in the Philippines who do this, and they did a bad job, and then. Okay, they just made it. I'm, I want to be cognizant of your time. Are you good? Okay. This was extremely helpful, though. Like, if we're 95 there, that's like, I think, I think, honestly, it's good. Like, I think this is very helpful. Yeah. Maybe Huge. Yeah. And honestly, as, as, as much as it seems like we did, you know, what was supposed to be a quick chat, and now 35, we only have so many customers, so if we repeated this three times or four times, we'd be in a really good place. Keep in mind, this is the most, like, tangled. So this is definitely the most tangled thing before I said, I feel like I've been told what that kind of thing before. Like, don't worry. This is the most complex. I mean, objectively, I was this, I was to decide between which of the four customers that are not agreeing to work on. And they gave him flex. They gave him. That's super helpful. Yeah. Appreciate it. Okay. By recording.
